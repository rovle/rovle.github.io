                        <h2>A Catalogue of Interspecies Friendships</h2>
                        <p>
                        It comes as a comfort to me when I see attachment between two species which aren't wired for connection between each other. It makes me feel that <em>more</em> is possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        That's why I tried to create a non-exhaustive catalogue of various such friendships of which one can find videos on the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                    <p>Kumbali, the cheetah, needed a companion. After he got to know Kago, the two became inseparable.</p>

                        <p>
                        (It should be noted that I do not consider these examples as a proof of some kind of a deep cosmic pattern of love between all beings. Indeed, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo">think</a> that one can have any combination of "capability" and morality/empathy/goals in a being. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it might be evidence of the shared empathy backbone between mammals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that is nice, too, kinda.)
