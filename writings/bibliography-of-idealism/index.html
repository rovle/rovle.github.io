		<h2>Annotated Bibliography of Idealism</h2>

			<p><em>In which I collect various writings and miscellanea that make it easier for me to love the humanity.</em></p>
		</div>
    <div class="epigraph">
      <blockquote>
      <p>“It always makes me proud to love the world somehow – hate's so easy compared.”</p>
      <p><em>Big Sur</em>, Jack Kerouac</p>

    <p>Some of our successors might live lives and create worlds that, though failing to justify past suffering, would give us all, including some of those who have suffered, reasons to be glad that the Universe exists.</p>
    <p><em>On What Matters</em>, Derek Parfit</p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
          It is tough to stay positive in this life. It is yet tougher to stay motivated to improve the world despite its stubborn disinclination for change. We are faced everyday with cruelty, injustice, blatant inequality — but perhaps even more dramatically, we are faced with our own indifference. The pains of the world cannot hurt us as much as they <em>should</em>. We are unable to react appropriately, the tally of Earth's horrors not outweighing our immediate need for comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What are we to do?</em> It is all too easy to resolve this dissonance in favor of apathy, but there are other ways. You could, instead, recognize that you are a member of a species woefully limited. You could recognize that your <em>wish to make the world better</em> is just as true and valid, despite your cognition having been implemented on a hardware which cannot modulate its own moods, with very limited control over its wants and motivations, plagued with systematic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">errors in judgment</a> — and unable even to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy/scope-insensitivity">multipy</a>!</p>
        <p>
          And then, after you've allowed yourself to wish for better things even though you don't always act like they're your top priority, you can allow yourself to kindle that wish. If you want that, that is why this page is here. It is a collection of people's visions and wishes. A repository of challenges to the dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          A final note should be given about how I have selected these pieces. I have tried to mostly include those which seem to engage the hurt of the world on (even if just slightly) more than sentimental level, which at least try (even if incredibly vaguely) to sketch some part of the road ahead; on the difficult path of <em>actually making this world better</em>.

        <h3>"That's here. That's home. That's us."</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="epigraph"> 
          <blockquote>
          <p> “The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us – there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.” </p>
          <p><em>Cosmos</em>, Carl Sagan</p>
          </blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
        <p>
          I could scarcely imagine beginning this bibliography with anyone other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>.  Though I'm not sure how well it holds up nowadays — the last time I've watched through the whole series was probably around 10 years ago — his TV Mini Series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081846/">Cosmos</a> is full of inspiring moments. Sagan outlines a path through science, through <em>understanding the cosmos</em>, and though some aspects of that vision might be... insufficient for our current age, it is a beautiful path nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is wholly unsurprising, given the love and gentleness of <em>Cosmos</em> (and other Sagan's works) that he was very concerned about the prospect of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter">nuclear winter</a>. A recurring motif among people whose works shine the kind of light I'm interested in is thinking that threats to humanity's survival are <em>really, really bad.</em>
        </p>
      <p>
        Before you settle in to watch 13 hours of Sagan discovering the Cosmos in his spaceship of the imagination — that really is a thing! — we need to talk about a picture.
